# Sysnames

A Rust library for Linux system call names and numbers based on [Marcin Juszkiewicz's excellent repository].
The goal is to help you work with system call information in Rust.
For example, this library might be particularly useful when working with [libbpf-rs].

## Disclaimer

This library is currently a work in progress. Expect updates regularly. Semantic versioning will be followed after the 1.0.0 release.
